**Objective:** Today, we explored the React state lifecycle and delved into advanced hooks like `useContext` and `useReducer`. These concepts were practiced to understand managing complex state and providing context across components.

**Reflective:** enlightening

**Interpretive:** The session highlighted the power of `useContext` for simplifying prop drilling and `useReducer` for handling intricate state logic. Understanding the React state lifecycle clarified how components behave and update, making the concepts more practical for real-world applications.

**Decision:** I plan to integrate `useContext` and `useReducer` in future projects to manage state more effectively and further explore the React lifecycle to optimize component behavior.
