**Objective:** Today, we practiced using React to interact with APIs, focusing on `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE` operations. Additionally, we explored a UI component library to build consistent and visually appealing user interfaces.

**Reflective:** practical

**Interpretive:** Working with React for API calls reinforced the importance of proper state management and error handling in dynamic applications. Learning to use a UI component library demonstrated how pre-designed components can speed up development and maintain design consistency.

**Decision:** I plan to refine my API integration skills by implementing advanced use cases and experiment with customizing UI components to better align with project requirements.
